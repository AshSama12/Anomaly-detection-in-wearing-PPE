# Anomaly-detection-in-wearing-PPE
This is my latest ongoing research project


•	Aims: To create an effective anomaly detection system that identifies whether construction workers are wearing the necessary PPE (helmet, vest, and boots) to ensure their safety. 
 
•	Objectives: 
	To design an accurate deep learning model for detecting anomalies in the wearing of personal         
  protective equipment (helmet, vest, boots) by construction workers.
  Achieve high precision and recall. 
  Ensure system resilience to lightening changes and weather changes.
